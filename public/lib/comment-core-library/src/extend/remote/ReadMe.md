# Remote Server
The CommentCoreLibrary-Remote section is an implementation of a websocket based remote communicating service.
This opens up the possibility of realtime comments/messages broadcasted through the hosting network. This is essential
for advanced features such as online user count and comment/filter streaming or comment sending.

## Details
Included are implementations of the service module. Included also is a Node.js Javascript serverside implementation.

# 远程同步协议
CommentCoreLibrary还将包含一套远程通讯协议，它将通过WebSockets技术实现与服务器的即时通讯。这将为实时评论和聊天室等功能
打下基础。一些搞基功能，如在线人数统计，将在此环境下更好的实现。
